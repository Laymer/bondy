    %% REVIEW SUPERVISION TREE, MAYBE SPLIT IN SUPERVISORS TO ADOPT
    %% MIXED STRATEGY
    %% TODO, we should use rest_for_one strategy.
    %% If the registry or the wamp forwarder dies it is useless to
    %% accept HTTP requests. Also they need to wait for the registry
    %% to restore data from disk and maybe perform an exchange
    {ok, {{one_for_one, 1, 5}, Children}}.
